# Week 3 report
## hours used: 6.5

## Progress of the Project:
Added support for division and Parentheses '(' and ')'.   

The calculator now gives an Integer result back when given an formula.  

Division currently is working on integers so calculations of 4/2 and 8/4 are successfull, but 3 / 2 will not give decimal output.  
Started work on POWER(X, Y) function, but it is not yet supported.  Thought about ideas of how user defined functions could work.  

## Lessons learned and challenges encountered:  
No big challenges were encountered during this week other than of limited time to work on this project during the week.

I got sidetracked when I started implementing POWER(X, Y) function and started thinking about solving user defined functions which consumed some time. Although I gained more insight how I could do them, the time spent probably prevented me from having enough time to fully implement the POWER function.  

## Goals for next week:
