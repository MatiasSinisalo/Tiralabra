# Week 6 report
# spent hours: 8.5 h

# Progress of the application:
Added implementation document and some instructions on how to use the calculator to README.  

User defined functions are now supported. The functions work correctly as part of other mathematical expressions and the user can use variables as part of the functions as long as those variables are defined beforehand. The concept of function arguments' was not implemented.  

The calculators interpreter now performs missing token checks and returns error messages as feedback.  

# Lessons learned and problems encountered:
In my opinion the calculators error messages should still be more accurate. 

The application is also missing integration tests where the calculator is tested through the CLI.  

Overall I'm quite happy with the progress achieved. Maybe I should have allocated more time towards this project this week in order to implement arguments to user defined functions.

There are a couple of places on the project where the code could be made more readable and less repeatable. 

# Goals for the next week:
- Interpreter should tell the user what token caused an interpreter error.
- Integration testing.
- Maybe implement custom function arguments.
