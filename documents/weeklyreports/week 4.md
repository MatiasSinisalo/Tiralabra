# Week 4 report
## used hours: 10

## Progress of the application:
The app now supports multi digit numbers, and has two functions: POWER(A, B), SQRT(A). 
Started work on errors for incorrect input to the calculator. 


## Lessons learned and problems encountered:  
Large chunk of time was spent rewriting the tokenizer to support errors and to allow easier addition of different functions to the calculator.  
The new version of the tokenizer ended up being easier to expand and it was interesting to not use regex for the input string. 
Although It is likely that by using regex it would have been faster to implement the tokenzier. 


## goals for the next week:
