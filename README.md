# Tiralabra Scientific Calculator

Programming language: c++  
User interface: CLI, cin/cout

The goal is to build an scientific calculator using the Shunting yard Algorythm that calculates the value of a given mathematical argument.
This project is built as a part of my computer science bachelors studies in Helsinki Universitiy (fin: tietojenk√§sittelytieteen kandidaatti (TKT)).

Planned features of the calculator:

1. basic mathematical operations using numerical values:
    - Addition
    - Substraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Square root
    - Exponent
2. Support for braces ()
3. Support for variables
    - a numerical value can be assigned to a variable
    - variables should support the same mathematical operations described above
4. Support for functions
    - user should be able to define a function f(x) and then be able to use it as a part of function g(x)
    - for example: f(x) = 2x and g(x) = f(x) + 3
